   <p> I am a LCC student. I am from Philadelphia, PA, but moved to Lansing in 2016.  I am trying to obtain the necessary skills to become a web developer and hopefully make a career change.  I enjoy learning how to program and learning how the internet works in more detail.  I just began using the Linux operating system and like how it is structured and the fact that it uses less resources than Windows.  My email address is <a href = "mailto:awutacoe@mail.lcc.edu">awutacoe@mail.lcc.edu </a>.</p>
